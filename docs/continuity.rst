Continuity
==========
Let :math:`f` be a function. If :math:`f` has :math:`f(x_0)` has a limit at `x_0`, we say that :math:`f` is continuous at :math:`x_0`. If :math:`A` is a set of real numbers and :math:`f` is continuous at every point of the set, we say that :math:`f` is continuous on :math:`A`. This is especially appropriate when :math:`A` is a segments: all points between :math:`a` and :math:`b`.

Assume that :math:`f` is continuous on :math:`[a,b]`, all points between :math:`a` and :math:`b`, inclusive. We want to show that there is some :math:`M` such that :math:`|f(x)|M`, :math:`a\leq x_n\leq b`. Since :math:`x_n` is a bounded sequence of real number, there is a convergent subsequence :math:`x_{n_k}`. We note that since :math:`n_k\geq k`, :math:`|f(x_{n_k})|>n_k\geq k`. :math:`x_{n_k}` converges to :math:`x_0`, and so :math:`a\leq x_0\leq b`. Therefore, :math:`f(x_{n_k})` converges to :math:`f(x_0)`. But :math:`f(x_{n_k})` is not a bounded sequence, which is a contradiction. Therefore, :math:`f` is bounded on :math:`A`.

Let us again assume that :math:`A` is a segment, and :math:`f` is continuous there. Assume that there is a :math:`\epsilon_0` such that for every :math:`\delta` there is an :math:`x, y` such that :math:`|x-y|<\delta` and :math:`|f(x)-f(y)|\geq \epsilon_0`. Now let us take :math:`x_n` to be such an :math:`x` for :math:`\delta=1/n`. :math:`x_n` has a convergent subsequence, :math:`x_{n_k}` converging to :math:`x_0`. We know that :math:`f` is continuous at :math:`x_0`. Let us take a :math:`\delta` corresponding to :math:`\epsilon_0/2`. We have that if :math:`|x-x_0|<\delta` than :math:`|f(x)-f(x_0)|K`, :math:`|x_{n_k}-x_0`<\delta/2`. Now we know that for every :math:`x_{n_k}` there is a :math:`y_k` such that :math:`|x_{n_k}-y_k|K` and such that :math:`1/k<\delta/2`, we have :math:`|y_k-x_0|<\delta`, so :math:`|f(y_k)-f(x_0)|<\epsilon/2`, and therefore we have :math:`|f(x_{n_k})-f(y_k)|=|f(x_{n_k})-f(x_0)+f(x_0)-f(y_k)|\leq |f(x_{n_k})-f(x_0)|+|f(x_0)-f(y_k)|<\epsilon_0/2+\epsilon_0/2=\epsilon_0` in contradiction to the definition of :math:`k`. Therefore, there is no such :math:`\epsilon_0`, and so for every :math:`\epsilon` there is a :math:`\delta` such that if :math:`|x-y|<\delta` then :math:`|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon`. In this case, we call :math:`f` uniformly continuous on :math:`A`. As we have seen, every continuous function on a segment is uniformly continuous.

Assume :math:`f` is a continuous function on a segment :math:`A`. We know that :math:`f` is bounded from above. In other words, the set :math:`B={f(x):x\in A}` has an upper bound, and therefore a least upper bound, say :math:`c`. In other words, if :math:`d<c`, there is an :math:`x`, :math:`d<f(x)\leq c`. Define :math:`x_n` to be such an :math:`x` for :math:`d=c-1/n`. Now we have :math:`x_{n_k}` a converging subsequence, and :math:`c-1/k\leq c-1/n_k<f(x_{n_k})\leq c`. Assume that :math:`x_{n_k}` converges to :math:`x_0`. Then :math:`f(x_{n_k})` converges, by continuity, to `f(x_0)`, and by sandwich, to :math:`c`. Therefore, :math:`f(x_0)=c` and so the least upper bound is actually attained (in this case, we call it a maximum). For similar reasons, :math:`f` has a minimum on :math:`A`.

Let :math:`f` be a continuous function on a segment :math:`A=[a,b]`. If :math:`c` is such that :math:`f(a)<c<f(b)`, then there is an :math:`x`, :math:`f(c)=x`. Let :math:`a_n, b_n` be defined by :math:`a_0=a,b_0=b`. Let :math:`t=(a_n+b_n)/2`. If :math:`f(t)0`. :math:`t<t+\epsilon`, so :math:`x=f(t)0`, and for similar reasons :math:`\delta_2=f(t)-f(t-\epsilon)>0`. Define :math:`\delta` to be the smaller of the two. If :math:`|x-y|<\delta`, then :math:`f(t-\epsilon)=f(t)-(f(t)-f(t-\epsilon))<x-\delta_2\leq x-\delta<y<x+\delta<x+\delta_1=f(t)+f(t+\epsilon)-f(t)=f(t+\epsilon)`. Applying :math:`f^{-1}` to the inequality (since :math:`f^{-1}` is increasing) gives us :math:`t-\epsilon<f^{-1}(y)<t+\epsilon`, or :math:`|f^{-1}(y)-f^{-1}(x)|0`. If :math:`a>0` is a real number, then if we find :math:`M>a, M>1`, :math:`M^n>a`. :math:`0^n=00`, :math:`x^q` is a well defined real function on the non-negative numbers (and therefore, if we define :math:`x^{-q}=1/x^q`), we have :math:`x^q` is a well defined function on the positive numbers for any rational :math:`q`!
