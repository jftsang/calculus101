Limit
=====
Assume :math:`f(x)` is a real function defined on some interval containing a point :math:`x_0`. We want to have the equivalent of a "tail property" for sequences -- but this time for functions near :math:`x_0`. A property will be said to be a "local property" if whenever there exists a :math:`\delta>0` such that :math:`f(x)=g(x)` when :math:`|x-x_0|0`, :math:`f(x)=g(x)` for every :math:`x` such that `0<|x-x_0|0` such that for all :math:`x` such that :math:`0<|x-x_0|0` such that for the appropriate :math:`x`, :math:`f(x)<A`" is an lpf property. Similarly, :math:`B<f(x)` is an lpf property, and so is :math:`B<f(x)<A`. In that case, we will say that :math:`f` is locally between :math:`B` and :math:`A`.

Let :math:`C` be a number, and assume that for every :math:`\epsilon`, :math:`f` is between :math:`C-\epsilon` and :math:`C+\epsilon`. As a synonym, we will also say that :math:`f` has :math:`C` as a limit at :math:`x_0`. In that case, we say that :math:`f` tends to :math:`C` as :math:`x` tends to `x_0`. Making the definition more explicit: if for every :math:`\epsilon` there exists a :math:`\delta` such that if :math:`0<|x-x_0|<\delta` then :math:`C-\epsilon<f(x)<C+\epsilon` (or, equivalently, :math:`|f(x)-C|0`. We know that there is a :math:`\delta>0`, such that if :math:`0<|x-x_0|<\delta`, :math:`|f(x)-C|N`, :math:`0<|x_n-x_0|N`, :math:`|f(x_n)-C|0`, we see that :math:`f(x_n)` is a sequence converging to :math:`C`. So we have: if :math:`f` has a limit at `x_0`, :math:`f(x_n)` will converge to the same limit if for every sequence :math:`x_n` converging to :math:`x_0`.

Now, assume that for every sequence converging to :math:`x_0`, :math:`x_n`, :math:`f(x_n)` converges to :math:`C`. Does that mean that :math:`f` has a :math:`C` as a limit at :math:`x_0`? Assume the opposite. Then there is some :math:`\epsilon_0` such that for every :math:`\delta`, we have some :math:`x` such that :math:`0<|x-x_0|\epsilon_0`. For :math:`\delta=1/n`, take :math:`x_n` to be one such :math:`x`. Then :math:`0<|x_n-x_0|\epsilon_0`, so that :math:`f(x_n)` does not converge to :math:`C`, in contradiction to the original assumption. Therefore, if applying :math:`f` to every sequence converging to :math:`x_0` yields a sequence converging to :math:`C`, then :math:`f` has a :math:`C` as a limit at :math:`x_0`.

Because of that, we can use much of what we know of sequence convergence for function limits. For example, this implies that :math:`f+g` will have as its limit the sum of the limits, and similarly for :math:`fg` and :math:`f/g`.
