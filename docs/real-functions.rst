Real functions
==============
Up until now, we have dealt with sequences -- functions from the natural numbers to real numbers. Now we turn our attention to functions from real numbers to real numbers, so-called "real functions".

A real function is a function from a set, :math:`A` to the real numbers, :math:`\mathbb{R}`. Usually :math:`A` will be an "interval" -- all numbers between two numbers, all numbers less than a number, all numbers greater than a number or all numbers.

We will usually keep :math:`A` implicit, and assume it contains anything we are interested in.

If :math:`f` and :math:`g` are functions, :math:`f+g` is the function defined by :math:`(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)`. Similarly, we define :math:`fg`, :math:`-f` and :math:`f-g`. If :math:`f` is a function, everywhere that :math:`f(x)\ne 0`, we can define :math:`1/f`.

We note that with these definitions, functions on a given set :math:`A` obey the so-called ring axioms.

The simplest example of a function is :math:`f(x)=a`, the constant function. The next-simplest example of a function is :math:`f(x)=x`, the identity function.

With these two functions,
